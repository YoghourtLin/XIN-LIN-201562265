I visited my GP and decided to take his advice to use Lets Talk.  
I phoned the service and was immediately contacted for a telephone assessment. During the initial call I was told how the service could help and support me with clear instruction on timing due to lockdown.  
After my telephone assessment I was contacted by Steven my Therapist. I was reluctant to talk with a stranger let alone a man, but l couldn’t have been in better hands. During our sessions, Steven was sympathetic, kind and extremely understanding, which was absolutely vital to my mental recovery.  
I used the service for 3 months, and although it was brief, this was everything l needed to get me back to being me again.

Being ignored,shouted at,left to cry with such pain and anxiety and not getting full explanations about what’s going on is no way to treat us. I have regularly received this type of treatment off doctors, I know they are busy, and they are good at what they do but seems that some doctors forget who they are talking to most of the time, which is sick and confused people. They do not seem to like it when patients know a lot about their conditions or us patients who like a proper in-depth explanation on everything that’s happening. But by them taking the extra 5-10 minutes explaining properly, can solve a lot of issues and confusion and lower our anxiety levels.

4157,ds,Dignity,Feeling safe including bullying,"Malvern ward  
The Sense of community project hasn’t been directed at the individual diagnoses on the ward. I felt that big personality’s tried to rule the roost and patients with smaller personalities tended to get overlooked or misunderstood and their ideas invalidated.  
The effect is then negative for the latter group. They have skills that are not being recognized, used, valued or validated. I have valued my independence and being strong minded against ‘invasive forces’- these are not necessarily a person but could be something you want, something you fear or anything wanted or not wanted.  
There have been challenged for the Sense of Community project which have included bullying, time constraints, materials and goods not arriving on time, changes in routine, having to deal and communicate with more people that I am used to dealing with. Also, it has been a challenge having privacy and a safe environment in which to express those ideas that are mine. I wouldn’t say there have been any positive changes on my ward since doing the project. I felt it provided the big personalities with more ‘power’. People of different types of personality were polarised.  
If we were to do a future project can we have more places to order supplies from? And can we have better staffing or protected time on the ward, regardless of what’s going on, so it can happen?

His GP prescribed an antidepressant and told us that they would like to refer him to CAMHS but couldn’t because he was too close to being 18 when the adult service would take over. Suggested some NHS counselling services but when contacted they replied that they were unable to offer him anything until he was 18. He deteriorated further and 2 weeks later had a serious suicide attempt, ending up in hospital. He was told he would see a DPN from CAMHS prior to Discharge. He waited 6 hours for someone to come who told us that they were actually not a proper member of the crisis team. We asked about his ongoing antidepressant medication and were told that it would be discussed at the crisis team MDT the following day and his GP would be contacted. He was made a follow up appointment with the crisis team 10 days later.  
The outcome of the MDT was not communicated promptly to his GP who had to chase it up and in fact was advised not to give any further medication - however, fortunately our GP started another drug anyway. The follow up appointment was with a ‘practioner’ and health care assistant who offered no suggestions for treatment and was a total waste of time. They again told us to contact the counselling services who had already turned him down. Our GP received no communication from them and tried to speak to a consultant, but this was unhelpful.  
He has remained very ill and has had absolutely no treatment offered by CAMHS for 8 weeks. My husband and I both work within the NHS and in both of our services there is proper provision for 17 year olds to transition across to adult services.

4845,ee,Environment/ facilities,Environment/ facilities,"Hi I’m A Catherine Wheel and I access my Nottingham City East local mental health services at The Stonebridge Centre. Stonebridge is what my post is all about.  
If you go down to the Stonebridge Centre today, you’re in for a big surprise. It’s just re-opened after our co-produced refurbishment, and now you’ll hardly believe your eyes. It’s as evidence-based as a picnic under Milkwood.  
For starters the outdoor areas are litter-free; now gone the tall wire perimeter fences. The green bits are tidy, all window shutters are open, and someone’s put a bench out. You can see the signs noting the Trust being positive about mental health, quite clearly now the wire’s gone.  
Everyone can walk right in. No deserving/undeserving questions asked. No staff/people divide by entitlement to the locked door codes. And this is carried through along all those formerly locked away inside corridors. It’s a proper free for all now.  
A bit in, there’s a creative space with a repurposed table and chairs, mags and books shelf, little boxes full of ticky tacky to explore, imagine, create with, so everything looks the same and nothing like it. There’s other chairs etc too, for reading, reflecting, relaxing, and to be.  
Near by there’s a viewing area for the telly, with separate, soft, comfy chairs plus other seating for people who can’t do comfy. People decide what to watch and operate the telly themselves, like grown-ups do.  
Next there’s a table of help yourself refreshments. There’s access to several toilets, not our usual only one. No more having to dash to the gp practice up the road where you can walk in, and use theirs, without challenge, deviation or hesitation.  
The What’s the Buzz corner’s got updates from the Trust, and our co-produced “tipping points” facts, ideas, things to try sheets on such a wide range of topics. For example one about highs and lows, hearing voices, another on depression, others like - on being a thoughtful elder, anxiety, stress, a good night’s sleep. I saw the one I helped with about coming off Seroxat.. They’ve got leaflets on what principles the Services are based on. Explanations about policies and practices, what you can access from here, and how to keep in the know, and meet other service users in the same boat as you. There was info from all sorts of organisations, and about places with things to do, info about things for all our diversities, interests, and pockets. And the whole lot dated, and where it came from so no one would go away with old stuff or no leads. Yes, even all the above in a variety of presentations: pictures, song, dance, soundings , sightings, signings, hearings, ranges of colours, languages, all sorts of ways to take the message home.  
There was also our adds board for passing it on….like our skills in digital stuff, and how we can help each other with all kinds of things respectfully and safely.  
I noticed adds for us about getting together to co-make a zine, and an audio-visual. Adds to have co-realised discussions, to co-make ways to share our thoughts, findings, about what it’s like, and our collective, shared vision, shared hope, shared dream of ways to be. All our difference, all coming together with the threads that hold us in common humanities, and personhoods.  
Oh yes, I thought you might like to know the Reception staff have all been on a pamper weekend with workshops on being nice, not grumpy. They had a ball by all accounts. All’s well with the world of reception now. Like us, they just needed someone to be kind to them too.  
I looked around, at it all. And it made me feel like I’m part of all this. That together we are stronger, solider, warmer. We’re connected, interrelated, and interdependent. We did this together, thought it through, got on with it, and now we’re maintaining it together and taking it forward. Others will join in and take it over. Pass it on. All of us co-producers.  
And I remembered how we asked around for the tables and the chairs and all the stuff. The times all of us got together to make everything nice. I thought of how talented and limited people are, of hidden depths, stirrings, and undercurrents.  
And I couldn’t help myself, I smiled big time, remembering how I was given the sledge hammer to bash that intercom outside the front door, which locked the staff in, and locked us lot out, baring us lot’s entry to Stonebridge. And I revisited my proud moment when I smashed that locked door policy to smithereens, and caught a fleeting glimpse of Duncan Macmillan, smiling, as the doors of the Asylum unlocked again.  
Not quite sure how to end this post. Might have to break the second rule of writing. This is: when you’ve finished a hopey, dreamy, wishy, wayward piece, you must never, end with:

4594,sa,Staff,Attitude Of Staff,"I have been under the mental health team at stonebridge since my last hospital admission in December last year. My mental health has deteriorated since June and have been seeing the duty team. We came to a decision that I needed a medication review with the consultant. The consultant I used to see had recently left the team so after nearly a 2 month wait, I got in with a locum consultant.  
Both appointments left me feeling frustrated, upset, and wary of the decisions being made. The consultant hadn't read my notes so didn't know the reason for the appointment. In fact, the first question was; ""have you ever seen a psychiatrist before"". After telling them my concerns over my medication, it was dismissed and I was made to feel like I was looking for a ""magic pill"" fix, where in fact I am aware medication won't cure me; a point I made to the consultant. I got upset and was emotional due to anxiety and my low mood. This wasn't acknowledged. After my medication concerns were dismissed, and the consultant hadn't heard of the mentalization therapy I'd been in under NHS for a year, I got up to leave. The consultant asked me to sit down which I did. They then spent 5mins in silence, looking in the bnf. Then decided to take me off one of my medications (not the one I had raised concerns about) and wanted me to start a new one. By this point, I was emotionally exhausted and frustrated by the consultants tone and manner so I accepted what they said and left.  
I was very emotional for the rest of the day and needed to phone the duty team. I spoke to a nurse who helped me understand as the consultants notes said more than they had told me in the appointment. Why they chose the new medication. The acknowledgement of my mood. I was told I could tell my story here but I decided to give the consultant the benefit of doubt.  
Turns out the new medication prescribed isn't available on the NHS. And following a phone call from the pharmacist in my gp surgery, the consultant had decided to reduce the dose of another medication without consulting me. In fact, I believe the consultant had misread my notes and believed I was on a lower dose than I was, and following a chat with my pharmacist, decided I should be on the lower dose anyway.  
I rang the Stonebridge centre the next day to clarify what the plan was, and to highlight the error. The reception staff and the consultant secretary were as confused as me as my notes clearly stated my original dose of medication. And were confused why I would be prescribed a medication unavailable on NHS. They arranged for me to come in ASAP to resolve the issue. I requested someone to sit in the appointment with me as I felt uncomfortable seeing the same consultant.  
The nurse on duty sat in. This appointment had similar frustration, confusion and made me upset. The consultant's mistake over medication dose and decision behind my back were barely acknowledged as a mistake and I was made to feel a burden as they had to take time out to speak to the pharmacist and again to me today. They didn't apologise about prescribing a medication I couldn't get on the NHS, and spent more time trying and failing to log into my notes than actually talking to me. The nurse was fantastic and supportive. She helped me come to a decision about medication and make a plan forward. The consultant tried to give me another new medication which I declined, and took a long time to catch up on what medication I was on and make a plan. If it wasn't for the nurse, I'd have reached breaking point. The medication review was suppose to be helpful, not stressful.  
I understand stresses on the NHS and workloads. I understand that mistakes can happen. But the lack of communication and apology, along with being made to feel like I was causing more work was unacceptable. It triggered intrusive thoughts, paranoia, and I felt fed up. I have seen many consultants. And each one has a different view and preference on medication. I am tired of changing medication to meet the new consultants preference.",735,5,Information provided

Over the past six months Liz has incredibly supportive and insightful. With her guidance I feel significantly more confident as a Mum of two and my anxiety and depression symptoms have reduced enormously.  
Everything about my treatment from Liz was great, I never felt rushed when I met with her, she listened intently to me even when I could only manage an incoherent jumble of words and she has provided some techniques such as VIG which helped me view my relationship with my children from a different perspective.  
Liz is absolutely brilliant at her job and although we did not meet under pleasant circumstances I have really enjoyed working on my recovery with her.
