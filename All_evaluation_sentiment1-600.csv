Being a single parent to two children I really felt I struggled with my son's behaviours.

This made me feel very upset. The 123 magic was an amazing course and very interesting Lorraine made the course very easy to follow. By the end of the course the the phone calls stopped from nursery and my son even got a certificate for good behaviour! I feel very confident with doing the 123 magic in public and I can now take both my children out on days out, which I couldn't do before. I am so grateful for to Lorraine for everything she has done.

It made me feel that there was an outlet for my frustration at being locked in ward, but equally important I had access to equipment which enabled me to express my illness. It was a therapeutic experience of healing my mental illness.

I had an appointment recently with the mental health nurse that I am under. This person reviews me every few months.  
I suffer from emotionally unstable personality disorder. In the appointment, I had described my struggles coping with change in my treatment with occupational therapy. I struggle with change. I struggle dealing with feelings of abandonment.  
Toward the end of the appointment the nurse questioned if being under secondary mental health services was right for me at this time. They suggested that being in the service keeps me in ""sick mode"".  
This triggered me quite badly. The nurse observed this. I became really tearful and disconnected because it triggered a lot of intrusive thoughts.  
Unfortunately for me this was 5 minutes before the appointment ended.  
I don't question their motives for asking these questions. They are the professional and might be right in what they are saying.  
What I found completely unacceptable, was ending the appointment with me in the state I was in. I was extremely vulnerable and felt judged and dismissed. Being left to deal with this on my own should not have happened. If I had been in this state at home, triggered by something else, it would have been a time I reached out for support from the centre. But how could I when they caused it and dismissed me?  
I don't know whether it is wrong for me to expect the nurse to sit with me to ride out the emotions while they were so intense? I don't think it's alot to ask or to expect.  
I am now left untrusting of the centre whilst I'm in a very vulnerable state of mind.  
I hope this doesn't happen often in this centre. They are meant to be the ones who help in these situations. Not cause them.",329,-0.9157,neg,neg

She also helped me with various other activities to get me out and to grow my bond with my baby.

My post is about Humbling Pie and eating it, at the Stonebridge Centre  
For some time I’ve been chuntering, moanin’ un groanin’ about the reception staff at the Stonebridge Centre and now I take it all back because I have made two visits recently and have been welcomed and looked after with the utmost cheer and helpfulness. So I’m overjoyed to now be eating humble pie despite failing to find the custard app on my laptop.  
A whopping thank you to the staff on reception. You have supplied mugs so I could have some water - twice, spent a great deal of time procuring a prescription that had not been left with you for me to collect, and helped me with some pronunciation queries.  
If this is not enough on both occasions I buzzed the intercom to get in the Centre, and you kindly and encouragingly said to just open the door. This was further topped on both occasions with a welcoming reassuring smile and warm greeting. This had a very positive affect on me as on both occasions I was quite anxious. The latter time because I was seeing a psychiatrist I had never met before and felt worried and tense about this. You put me so much at ease that the consultation started well and progressed even better. I think you enabled the tone of that consultation to be set so that I could benefit a great deal from the appointment. Thank you so much.  
I feel warm inside writing this post. It brings to mind those old school days in the Netherlands recalled in the song I can’t remember. That occasion…..  
I ate humble pie  
When I was in Reception  
I thought you’d never change  
At the Stonebridge Centre  
You have proved me wrong  
Greeting me with a friendly look in your eyes  
Made me realise  
Humble Pie’s just my dessert  
You’re surely ace  
Now I see us all in sweetness and light  
I have to say  
i was oh so wrong  
And I’ve learnt something else now, that's right  
I am just amazed  
At your warm welcome  
Makes me want to come  
To the Stonebridge Centre  
Who needs custard on pie  
Now a bottomless jug of your love’s  
Held out to me  
By your care and kindness  
At the Stonebridge Centre  
Thank you, thank you, thank you  
And it’s down to you  
You’re really great, thank you

I so want to thank you, thank you

After a few days in Lings Bar her distress was increasing and we were told it was probably seizures due to her dementia.
They decided that she should go back to Queens and called an ambulance. The ambulance crew said it wouldn't be seizures as she was able to grip our hand and most likely could be a water infection!
I asked if this could be the case in Lings Bar and was told she didn't have an infection and anyway they were a rehab centre and not a quote ""medical ward""
After arriving in A&E we were told she DID HAVE A WATER INFECTION AND THEY TREATED HER FOR THIS with antibiotics.
Mum recovered quite quickly as is back on a ward in queens Med.
It would seem to me and I know more than most because we have had the misfortune to be in and out of hospital with cancer illness etc that our NHS system cannot cope with the amount of people using it.

In a nutshell, my daughter was not treated well at all by this service, both her and myself are most disappointed and I would not encourage anyone else to use it, if they would be treated the way in which my daughter was.  
The staff there need to appreciate that they are dealing with adults who have 'Aspergers Syndrome', hence many people mask their condition, which includes their feelings; as professional staff they should be able to detect that.  
There is far too much of a 'bull in a China shop' approach, in my opinion.  
Maybe that was just my daughter's experience but I expect them to make much more of an effort to engage with clients more satisfactorily.  
From our experience, we expect professionals to act professionally and this was not the case. This was most disappointing and I would be very reluctant to use the service myself and I know that my daughter feels exactly the same.

10741,cp,Care received,Physical care,"I recently went into hospital for a prostatectomy operation. I was admitted Monday morning and after the op, was taken to the recovery ward and then to the urology ward. I had surgical stockings, a catheter and six incisions in my abdominal area, one of which was dressed due to post-op bleeding. I had an allocated nurse when I arrived on the ward.  
The nurses on the ward change every 12 hours and so her shift finished at 7pm and a new team started and I had another nurse allocated. At 7am the next morning the day shift started again with a different set of nurses. One of my other wounds started bleeding so I called for a nurse to have a dressing applied. This she said she would do and duly came back with the dressing.  
My nominated nurse then came along and showed me how to change my catheter bag which was strapped to my leg and with which I would be going home with. She said that I had to change which leg I had the bag fixed to each day in order to avoid ""penis rot"" which was quite alarming to hear.  
I was then told that I could go home at 3.30pm that same day. In the meantime another wound had started to weep and I again called for a nurse to apply a dressing. This was done. When I was due to leave the ward I asked if I could have some spare dressings to take home with me. My nominated nurse said that I had to request them from the district nurse when I got home and that if I had any problems with my catheter I had to do the same and contact the district nurse.  
As I was leaving I wanted to ask my nominated nurse how long I had to wear the surgical stockings for. She was on a break so I asked one of the other staff nurses and she said that, as I was self injecting myself for 28 days with a blood thinner I only needed the stockings for a few days until I was mobile. I thought that this didn't sound right so I decided myself that I would wear them at least until my catheter was removed. The day after I got home my penis was quite sore and burning so I phoned the number given to me for the district nurse team.  
However, I actually got through to the emergency urology advise team and when I explained the situation I was told it was probably ""penis rot"" and to contact the district nurse team on the number he gave me on the phone. I duly contacted the team and asked if they could call and check my catheter and also could they bring some dressings as the ones I had needed changing and another was weeping and I only had simple plasters at home.  
I was told that they do not supply dressings as they only dealt with catheters and I had to go and see my GPs practice nurse for fresh dressings. At this point I was practically housebound due to mobility problems and had no way of getting to my GPs.  
The district nurse came out and said that my catheter had not been positioned properly on the ward and was pulling when I sat down causing the pain and burning sensation. He adjusted it and gave me an anaesthetic gel to use. When I mentioned the ""penis rot"" and having to change the position of the bag to alternate legs each day he said that was rubbish as ""penis rot"" only happened occasionally in men with long term catheters i.e. for months and changing the position each day would probably cause more harm than good.  
I went back to the urology ward a week later to have my catheter removed in a TWOC. This was quite painful and bled quite a lot. The nurse said that was usual and that I should drink extra water to dilute it out. I satisfactorily passed urine on the 3 occasions I needed to in order to go home and not have the catheter back in. I mentioned to the nurse about my wounds and dressings (at this point I only had plasters on). She said these were no good as they didn't breathe so she changed all the dressings and gave me some spare to take home. I also asked if I could take off my surgical stockings as I had my catheter out and was told that I had to wear them for at least a month.  
Throughout all this time I felt confused and frustrated with so many conflicting views.  
The op I had is pretty standard and I felt that, to save any confusion and to help the ward nurses who are extremely busy anyway, it may be a good idea to have a standard check list that clearly outlines what the procedure is for catheters/stockings/dressings etc and to have clear telephone numbers and information about where to go for after ward care.  
The ward had drawer fulls of dressings so why not send the patient home with spares? Why can't the district nurse team deal with dressings or other things apart from just catheters? Why isn't there a standard time on surgical stocking wear? and why aren't the people on the urology ward and emergency telephone line aware that ""penis rot"" is very occasional and only in long term catheter wearers and not for men like me who only had the catheter for 8 days? Also urology ward nurses in particular should know how to correctly position catheter bags and be able to give the correct advice on maintenance upon going home.",972,-0.946,neg,neg

11181,ap,Access,Provision of services,"I was refused a service. I was given no credible reason for this decision, despite asking for this on several occasions. The staff concerned made sweeping statements that bore no relevance to the nature of the assessment process and what was discussed, and was almost wholly inaccurate.
The staff member ""kindly"" offered that I could see another staff member , as though this was supposed to offer me an untainted assessment process, devoid of any infringement on my assessment process above that of the need for staff to ""get on"" (hardly credible).
The staff member fed back to me about some elements of the conversation during the assessment process that she felt deemed me unsuitable for their service, whilst having asked me about these issues in the first place!!,
I also felt that she made a comment that she had neither the information nor knowledge upon which to make such a judgement that, for someone less sure of their footing, could have undermined all the pain and heartache that had been involved to come to terms with what I had already resolved in my own mind. I found this arrogant as well as totally devoid of professional care nor responsibility; and totally disrespectful to me and the process I have had to go through in order to rebuild something of a life for myself.
I suspect the staff member has never had to struggle in such a way, hence her ability to dismiss this with such ease and lack of integrity.
The staff member even asserted that she could not work with people dynamics patients brought to discuss at the service unless she was on site!! And didn't even seem to think that ""people to people"" issues are not are areas they work on!! She asserted that they deal with ""trauma cases"". I wonder what ""traumas""? Breaking a leg skiing!! Or looking down when rock climbing!!
Very strange comment.
The building itself was dingy-typical of old mental institutions. It was drably decorated and clinical/devoid of pleasantness in its outlook. If you weren't low in spirits before you went to St Annes House, you would be by the time you had been in there for any length of time.
I notice on their website there is no information about the  level of Equality nor Diversity of the staff nor cases taken on/rejected. Hardly ""transparent"".
A series of ""declarations"" (ie policy statement) hardly gives any real idea of what this organisation is in relation to E&Diversity in reality.
As a consequence, I have had to submit a FOI request to obtain the information in relation to people referred and people subsequently offered a service. Poor.",433,-0.9105,neg,neg

12136,wa,Access,Time spent waiting for first appt/referral/service,"I saw first specialist last August after GP referred me May/June. She said she was referring me to Nottingham City Autism Service (as per the procedure). In February I learned that the referral had not been made and that I had somehow 'slipped through the net'. By this point Corona was on the horizon.  
I eventually got a phone consultation with Notts specialist 2 weeks ago. She informed me what a complex procedure diagnosis is and that due to Corona I am now looking at another year to full diagnosis.  
She did say she would send me details of support groups to help with anxiety the waiting is causing.  
Yesterday I received this. But one of the services is for 'people who identify as female'. I had specifically said in my consultation that I'm non binary. So not very helpful. The other service says it's for people with a diagnosis. So no idea if they will accept me.  
Just went on to the online survey and in gender options it only gives M / F or 'prefer not to say'. I was forced to tick 3rd option, as if I'm ashamed of my non binary status. Which is not the case at all.  
To be fair the actual consultation was ok and I should give a shout out to Dr Maliks secretary at Milbrook because she did try to push things through for me quickly when we realised I'd got missed.  
But there are issues with how this service is caring for diverse gender identities.  
Last thing - I have been given an appointment back at Milbrook in December, but I'm told this is not at all related to my diagnosis. So what is the point? Surely they should give that slot to someone waiting for 1st referral?",304,0.2736,pos,pos
